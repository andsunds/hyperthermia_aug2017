Of the data in here, the files are named 
"D#1_{full,ring}-[bessel-][AB-]#2_L-#3_{date}.mat"
#1: dimension(s)
#2: rotational order
#3: discretization size

{full,ring}: the full disc, or just a circle ring
[bessel-]: flag for the Bessel function method being used
[AB-]: flag for a tumor-head comparison
