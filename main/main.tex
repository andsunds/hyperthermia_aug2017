\begin{abstract}
Previous hyperthermia studies have shown that single-frequency signals
have been effective in focusing microwaves in a tumor. This seems to 
contradict the uncertainty principle for Fourier transforms, and this
report addresses this apparant inconcistency. To do this a method,
developed by Slepian et al., is applied to study the ability to focus
two dimensional fields, limited to different frequency bands, into a
circularly symmetric region representing the tumor. Also the Fourier 
version of the Heisenberg inequality is applied to electric fields. 
%What did we find out?
The maximum concentration of a bandwidth limited field inside the tumor 
region is calculated. It is shown that a wide band offers 
significant improvement over a narrow band. However a narrow band can 
still have a focusing effect.
It is also explained that the Heisenberg inequality is not contradicted due
to the directional freedom in two or more dimensions.

\section{Introduction}

The current hyperthermia treatments mainly utilize narrow band (NB) signals since simulations and numerical studies have not shown an increase of efficacy by using a wide band (WB)\cite{Martinsson}. 
However, there exists a number of uncertainty principles stating that a function cannot be highly localized in space and frequency at the same time. This would suggest the use of a wide band of frequencies, in contrast to prior studies.

This project aims to shed some light on this apparent inconsistency by taking a closer look at relevant uncertainty principles and applying them to a simplified case of scalar fields satisfying the wave equation in two dimensions.
First the Heisenberg inequality, a lower limit of the product of the field's variance in the two domains, will be applied.
Next, to get something more related to hyperthermia treatment a mathematical framework originally developed by Slepian et al., which speaks of how well a function limited in frequency can be localized in a bounded region of space, will be applied.

The main results show that it \emph{is} possible to obtain a localization of the E field with a single frequency but it is greatly enhanced with a WB signal. This is due to the fact that in higher dimensions there is also a \emph{directional} freedom involved. However as is discussed in Section~\ref{sec:SAR} the increased localization for WB signals does not apply to hyperthermia treatment. 

%Finally the results will be discussed from a hyperthermia treatment point of view and we will discuss some of the limitations as well as possible extensions of the theory.


\subsection{Limitations}
The human body contains many different materials and therefore a real hyperthermia treatment planning will often involve numerically solving Maxwell's equations to simulate how the E field will look in each specific case.

Since this project aims to extract what limitations the \emph{wave nature} sets, we are not concerned with the actual wave propagation -- instead we ask the question, given a perfect way to create or propogate the E field, what limits does a narrow band of frequencies and the wave equation set on the optimal distribution in a bounded region?

With this in mind the study is limited to a homogeneous material stretching through all space. The material is assumed lossless. %, although the case of lossy materials and dampened E field's will be discussed briefly in Section~\ref{sec:SAR}.
Further we limit ourselves to two dimensions since this suffices to capture the essential wave nature in higher dimensions whilst not overly complicating the mathematics. 
In this space we try to focus the distribution to a simple body, a disc, since we believe that most more complicated bodies would yield approximately the same results.

%We will also limit our attention to scalar fields, real E fields are in fact vectors with certain limitations to its directions which would produce slightly tighter bounds then what we achieved but this was unfortunately beyond the scope of this project.

Finally, for a real hyperthermia treatment it is not the intensity of the E field that is of concern but rather its time-average. This has significant implications for the frequency dependence of the effectiveness of the treatment, and will be discussed at some length in Section~\ref{sec:SAR}. However, the main part of this work is concerned with the intensity of the E field itself and not its time-average.


\subsection{Theory}
For each frequency $\omega$ the electric field will have a harmonic timedependence, and can be represented by phasor notation:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:phasor}
\vb*E(\vb*x,t)=\Re\qty[\vb*E(\vb*x)\ee^{-\ii\omega t}].
\end{equation}
In a lossless and sourceless homogeneous media the Maxwell equations then reduce to
\begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
\laplacian  \vb*E + k^2\vb*E=0,\\
\div\vb*E = 0,
\end{cases}
\end{equation} 
where $k^2 = \omega^2/v^2$, with $v=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu \epsilon}}$ being the speed of propagation. 

To simplify matters however, we will limit the scope of this project to scalar fields only satisfying the Helmholtz equation
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:Helmholtz}
  \qty(\laplacian + k^2)E=0.
\end{equation} 

\subsubsection{Plane wave decomposition}
One solution to the Helmoholtz equation \eqref{eq:Helmholtz} are the plane waves
\begin{equation}\label{eq:plane-wave}
E(\vb*x)=\tilde{E} \ee^{\ii\vb*k \cdot \vb*x},
\end{equation}
were the wavevector $\vb*k$ is any vector such that $\vb*k\vdot\vb*k=k^2$, and $\tilde{E}$ is a constant amplitude. 

The next step is to allow more for more than one frequency. The solution for each frequency will be of the form \eqref{eq:plane-wave}, each with its own amplitude $\tilde{E}(\vb*k)$. These solutions can then be summed up over all frequencies (magnitude as well as directions of $\vb*k$) and the final $E$ field becomes\footnotemark{}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:FT-inv}
E(\vb*x)= (2\pi)^{-D} \oldint_{\vb*k} \rd^Dk\,
\tilde{E}(\vb*k) \ee^{\ii\vb*k\vdot\vb*x}.
\end{equation}
\footnotetext{The factor of $(2\pi)^{-D}$ is just for convenience in the comparison with the $D$ dimensional Fourier transform.}

We can now identify \eqref{eq:FT-inv} as an inverse Fourier transform
of $\tilde{E}(\vb*k)$, and thus $\tilde{E}(\vb*k)$ has to be the Fourier transform of
$E(\vb*x)$:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:FT}
\tilde{E}(\vb*k) = \oldint_{\vb*x} \rd^Dx\, E(\vb*x)\ee^{-\ii \vb*k\vdot\vb*x}.
\end{equation}


\subsubsection{Polar wave decomposition in two dimensions}
If the problem exhibits some kind of circular symmetry, then polar coordinates often simplifies the math.
The two dimensional Helmholtz equation \eqref{eq:Helmholtz} in polar coordinates is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Helmholtz_polar}
\qty(\pdv[2]{r}+\frac{1}{r}\pdv{r}+\frac{1}{r^2}\pdv[2]{\theta})E+k^2E=0,
\end{equation} 
Which has the standard non-singular solution
\begin{equation} \label{eq:polar_wave}
E(r, \theta)=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} a_nJ_n(kr)\ee^{\ii n \theta}.
\end{equation}

Analogously to the plane wave decomposition, we now introduce a spectrum of frequencies, and obtain
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:polar_wave_general}
E(r,\theta)
=\oldint_{k} \rd k \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}\!\!a_n(k) J_n(kr)\ee^{\ii n \theta}
=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}\!\! \ee^{\ii n \theta} \oldint_{k} \rd{k}\,k\,b_n(k) J_n(kr),
\end{equation}
where in the last step $a_n(k)$ has been replaced with $k\,b_n(k)$ for later convenience.



\section{Localization measures and uncertainty} \label{sec:measures}
To start talking about focusing waves, one has to be able 
to quantify how localized it is. This is mainly done through
different measures on the energy distribution of the wave,
$\abs{f}^2$. 

This report will mainly deal with the fraction of energy in a bounded
area, which was used by
Slepian, Pollack and Landau (SPL) in a series of papers 
\cite{PSWF-I_1961,PSWF-II_1961,PSWF-III_1962,PSWF-IV_1964,PSWF-V_1978}.
However, to address the Heisenberg inequality, which
concerns a type of variance measure, an account of both types of
measures and how they are used will be given in this section. 


\subsection{The Heisenberg inequality}
\label{sec:Heisenberg_theory}
The common quantum mechanical version of Heisenberg's uncertainty
principle states that \emph{the product of the variance of
  position and momentum must be greater than some fixed value}. This
is rooted in the interpretation that position and momentum are
related through fourier transfrom. 

The general mathematical statement of the Heisenberg uncertainty
principle, for a function $f$ and its Fourier transfrom\footnotemark{}
$\tf$, is \cite{Folland} 
\footnotetext{With the Fourier transform defined as in \eqref{eq:FT}. }
\begin{equation} \label{eq:heisenberg}
\Delta_{\vb*a}f \Delta_{\vb*\alpha} \tf \geq \frac{D^2}{4} \quad 
%\forall \vb*a, \vb*\alpha, 
\forall f \in \Lsq{\infty},%[\mathbb{R}^2],
\end{equation}
where $\Delta_{\vb*a}f$ is a variance measure of $f$ is around
\emph{any} reference point $\vb*a$, analogously for
$\Delta_{\vb*\alpha}\tf$ and $\vb*\alpha$.
These variances are defined by
\begin{equation} \label{eq:spread_def}
\Delta_{\vb*a}f=
\frac{\oldint_{\vb*x}\rd^Dx\,\abs{\vb*x-\vb*a}^2\abs{f(\vb*x)}^2}
{\oldint_{\vb*x}\rd^Dx\,\abs{f(\vb*x)}^2},
\end{equation}
and analogously for the Fourier transfrom.


If $\Delta_{\vb*a}f$ is high, $f$ cannot be highly localized to one
single small neighbourhood in space. It does not however, preclude $f$
from having narrow peaks; there can exist several narrow peaks which
are spread out from each other and still have $\Delta_{\vb*a}{f}$
being large. 
For hyperthermia treatment, this means that the variation measure at
best gives a hint on what we want. It is possilbe to achieve a very
strong and narrow radiation peak inside the tumor without violating
the Heisenberg inequality, i.e. using NB signals, as long as a
significant part of the radiation intensity is located outside of the 
head.  
This is a consequence of the particular localization measure used in
the Heisenberg inequality. It is still a mathematical truth,
but it might be too blunt to be practically applicable in hyperthermia
treatments. 



\subsection{The Slepian-Pollack-Landau method}
\label{sec:SPL-method}
Another localization measure was used by SPL in
\cite{PSWF-I_1961,PSWF-II_1961,PSWF-III_1962,PSWF-IV_1964,PSWF-V_1978}. 
In what follows we will show the broad strokes for developing this
theory. 

A square-integrable function $f$ of $D$ variables is said to be
$\Omega$-limited if it can be represented as a Fourier integral over
the bounded region $\Omega$, 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:freq-lim}
f(\vb*x)=\qty(2\pi)^{-D}\oldint_\Omega \rd^Dk\,
\tf(\vb*k)\ee^{\ii(\vb*k \cdot \vb*x)} 
\end{equation}
i.e. it only contains frequencies in the area $\Omega$.


The energy of a function $f$ in a region $S$ is defined as 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:AS}
A_S=\oldint_S\rd^Dx\,\abs{f(\vb*x)}^2.
\end{equation}
Using Parseval's formula, the total energy of the $\Omega$-limited
function $f$ can be written as 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Atot}
A=\oldint_{R^D}\rd^Dx\, \abs{f(\vb*x)}^2 =
(2\pi)^{-D}\oldint_\Omega\rd^Dk\, \abs{\tf(\vb*k)}^2.
\end{equation}


By substituing \eqref{eq:freq-lim} into \eqref{eq:AS}, we get
\begin{equation}\label{eq:AS-KS}
\begin{aligned}
A_S%=\oldint_S\abs{f(\vb*x)}^2\id^Dx
&=\qty({2\pi})^{-2D} \oldint_S\rd^Dx \oldint_\Omega \rd^Dk\,
\tf(\vb*k)\ee^{\ii\vb*k\cdot \vb*x}
\oldint_\Omega \id^Dk'\,
\tf^*(\vb*k')\ee^{-\ii\vb*k'\cdot \vb*x}\\
&=\qty (2\pi)^{-D} \oldint_\Omega\rd^Dk\oldint_\Omega\rd^Dk'\,
\tf(\vb*k)\tf^*(\vb*k')K_S(\vb*k-\vb*k')\\
%&=\ip{I\tf}{\tf}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation} \label{eq:kernel}
K_S(\vb*k-\vb*k')=(2\pi)^{-D}\oldint_S\rd^Dx\,
\ee^{\ii\vb*x \cdot(\vb*k-\vb*k')},
\end{equation}
is called an integral \emph{kernel}.
Now define an integral operator $I_S$:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:int_op}
\qty[I_S g](\vb*k')=\oldint_\Omega\rd^Dk\, 
K_S(\vb*k-\vb*k')g(\vb*k).
\end{equation}
The fraction of energy that the $\Omega$-limited function $f$ can have
in a region $S$ can then be written as 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:energy_frac_final}
\frac{A_S}{A}=
\frac{\oldint_\Omega\rd^Dk\, \qty[I_S\tf](\vb*k)\tf^*(\vb*k)}
{\oldint_\Omega \rd^Dk\, \abs{\tf(\vb*k)}^2}
=\frac{\ip{I_S\tf}{\tf}}{\ip{\tf}},
\end{equation}
where we have defined an inner product on the $\Omega$-space:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:in_prod}
\ip{f}{g} =\oldint_\Omega\rd^Dk\, f(\vb*k)g^*(\vb*k).
\end{equation}


It can be shown that the integral operator \eqref{eq:int_op} is 
self-adjoint and compact. From the Spectral theorem it therefore follows
that the functions fullfilling the eigenvalue equation 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:eigen}
\qty[I_S\psi](\vb*k)=\oldint_\Omega \rd^Dk'\,K_S(\vb*k')\psi(\vb*k') 
=\mu \psi(\vb*k)
\end{equation}
form an orthogonal basis for the space $\Omega$. 
It also follows that the maximum of equation
\eqref{eq:energy_frac_final} is
the largest eigenvalue $\mu_0$ of equation \eqref{eq:eigen}. In
other words $\mu_0$ is an upper bound for the fraction of energy
in $S$ for an $\Omega$-limited function. 
This upper bound will be dependent on the geometries of the areas
$S$ and $\Omega$. The following section will be devoted to calculating
this $\mu_0$ for bandwidth-limited functions in two dimensions. 



\section{An example with bandwidth-limited fields in two dimensions}

Generating an electric field with frequencies ranging from $\omega_{\min}$ to $\omega_{\max}$\footnotemark{} corresponds to only allowing non-zero amplitudes for $k$ between $k_{\min}=\omega_{\min}/v$ and $k_{\max}=\omega_{\max}/v$ in the expressions for the $E$-field \eqref{eq:FT-inv} and \eqref{eq:polar_wave_general}.
This implies that the plane wave representation (Fourier transform) of the field only
has values on a circular ring of inner radius of $k_{\min}$ and outer radius $k_{\max}$; this region is denoted $\Omega$.
  \footnotetext{We call such a field bandwidth-limited.}

For the SPL method we wish to limit the field in space to a region $S$. We will study fields in two dimensions and
with the rotational symmetry of the Helmholtz equation in mind we choose the simplest of all regions, a disc with radius $R_S$.


\subsection{The SPL method using Fourier transforms}
%\todo[inline]{Move most of the math here to appendix!}
The methodology used here is a direct translation of the ones used in
\cite{PSWF-I_1961} and \cite{PSWF-IV_1964} to $S$ and $\Omega$. This
section will be somewhat short and superficial; this is due to the
fact that the next method will be much more efficient
numerically. Still, some useful tools will be developed
here.

%Althogh there are some useful tools which will be
%developed here.


From the definition of the kernel $K_S$ in equation \eqref{eq:kernel}, we get 
\begin{equation}
K_S(\vb*k-\vb*k') = (2\pi)^{-2}
\oldint_S \rd^2r \ee^{\ii\vb*r\vdot(\vb*k-\vb*k')}.
\end{equation}
By substituting to polar coordinates and using the usual Bessel
function expansion \cite[formula 8.551.4b]{Gradshteyn-Ryzhik} 
\begin{equation}
\ee^{\ii z\cos\theta} = \sum_{m=-\infty}^\infty
\ii^mJ_m(z)\ee^{\ii m\theta}
\end{equation}
and some other Bessel function identities 
\cite[formula~8.472.3]{Gradshteyn-Ryzhik}, we eventually end up with
\begin{equation}\label{eq:KS-short}
K_S(\vb*k-\vb*k') 
=(2\pi)^{-1}R_S\, \frac{J_1(R_S\Delta{k})}{\Delta{k}}.
\end{equation}
With the law of cosines
$\Delta{k}=\abs{\vb*k-\vb*k'}=\sqrt{k^2+{k'}^2-2kk'\cos(\Delta\theta)}$,
where $k=\abs{\vb*k}$, $k'=\abs{\vb*k'}$ and
$\Delta\theta=(\theta-\theta')$ is the angle between $\vb*k$ and
$\vb*k'$.

The numerical method described in Appendix~\ref{apx:num} can only be
applied to one dimensional integrals.
To reduce the eigenvalue equation \eqref{eq:eigen} to this form, first
note that $K_S(\vb*k-\vb*k')$ is $2\pi$-periodic in $\Delta\theta$,
and thus has a Fourier series expansion  
\begin{equation} \label{eq:KS-FS}
K_S(k, k', \Delta\theta)  
=\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty a_{n}(k, k')\, \ee^{\ii n\Delta\theta}
=\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty \ee^{\ii n\theta}\,a_{n}(k, k')\,\ee^{-\ii n\theta'},
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:KS-FS-coef}
a_{n}(k, k') = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} \rd(\Delta\theta)\; 
K_S(k, k', \Delta\theta)\ee^{-\ii n\Delta\theta}.
\end{equation}
Viewing \eqref{eq:eigen} as the definition of $\psi$, we also know
that the eigenfunctions, $\psi$, has to be periodic in 
$\theta$ since the kernel is periodic in $\theta$. Therefore
$\psi(k, \theta)$ also has to have a Fourier series 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:psi-FS}
\psi(k, \theta) = \sum_{m=-\infty}^\infty b_m(k)\ee^{\ii m\theta}.
\end{equation}
Substituting \eqref{eq:KS-FS} and \eqref{eq:psi-FS} into
\eqref{eq:eigen}, using polar coordinates and changing the order of
summation and integration, yields
\begin{equation}
\mu\sum_{l=-\infty}^\infty b_l(k)\ee^{\ii l\theta}
= \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty \ee^{\ii n\theta} \sum_{m=-\infty}^\infty 
\int_{k_{\min}}^{k_{\max}}\rd{k'}\,k' a_n(k, k') b_m(k')
\int_{0}^{2\pi}\rd\theta'\,
\ee^{\ii (m-n)\theta'}.
\end{equation}
The $\theta'$ integral is only non-zero when $(m-n)=0$ and
then the integral is just $2\pi$. We now get
\begin{equation}
\mu\sum_{l=-\infty}^\infty b_l(k)\ee^{\ii l\theta}
= 2\pi\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty \ee^{\ii n\theta} 
\int_{k_{\min}}^{k_{\max}}\rd{k'}\,k' a_n(k, k') b_n(k').
\end{equation}
By the uniqueness of Fourier series expansions, for all non-zero $b_n$
we finally obtain a one dimensional eigenvalue equation
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:eigen_fourier_coef}
\mu_n b_n(k) = 2\pi\int_{k_{\min}}^{k_{\max}}\rd{k'}\,k' a_n(k, k') b_n(k'),
\end{equation}
where $\mu$ has been denoted by $\mu_n$ since each $b_n(k)$
will have a different eigenvalue satisfying
\eqref{eq:eigen_fourier_coef}.  

To make \eqref{eq:eigen_fourier_coef} more suitable for numerical
solution, we wish to symmetrize the kernel $k'a_n(k, k')$. To do
that we make the substitution $b_n(k)=\phi_n(k)/\sqrt{k}$, which
yields 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:eig-n}
\mu_n \phi_n(k) = 2\pi\int_{k_{\min}}^{k_{\max}}\rd{k'}\,
\sqrt{kk'}a_n(k, k') \phi_n(k').
\end{equation}
This makes the kernel $\sqrt{kk'}a_n(k, k')$ symmetric in $k$ and
$k'$, since $a_n(k, k')=a_n(k', k)$ is already symmetric. Besides
making the numerical eigenvalue calculation more efficient, this also
has some nice mathematical implications, for instance $\phi_n$
constitutes an orthogonal base on $[k_{\min}, k_{\max}]$.

However, the problem with this method is that the Fourier coefficients
of the kernel, $a_n(k, k')$, cannot be calculated analytically by
direct integration using standard methods. This results in costly
numerical calculations since $a_n(k, k')$ has to be integrated
numerically for each pair of $k$ and $k'$, on top of then calculating
the eigenvalues. 
This problem stems from trying to adobt a plane wave decomposition to
polar coordinates. By starting from the polar wave decomposition one
can avoid these difficulties, which is what we will do in the
following section. 


\subsection{Reformulating the SPL method using Bessel decomposition}
The SPL method can be expanded to also cover polar decomposition
\eqref{eq:polar_wave_general}. The main idea of this generalization is
that for circularly symmetric geometries in 2D, polar decomposition
using Bessel function is more natural. 
This generalization will here be illustrated through the example using
$S$ and $\Omega$ as defined above, and the goal should be to
circumvent the problem of numerically evaluating the integral in 
\eqref{eq:KS-FS-coef}.

To calculate the energy of the field $E$ in the disk $S$, we
substitute \eqref{eq:polar_wave_general} into \eqref{eq:AS}: 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
A_S= \oldint_S \rd^2x\, \abs{E}^2 = 
\int_0^{R_S} r\rd{r} \int_0^{2\pi} \rd\theta \,&
\int_{k_{\min}}^{k_{\max}} \rd{k}\!\!
\sum_{n= -\infty}^{\infty}\!\! kb_n(k) J_n(kr)\ee^{\ii n \theta}\\
&\times
\int_{k_{\min}}^{k_{\max}} \rd{k'}\!\!
\sum_{m= -\infty}^{\infty}\!\! k'b_m^*(k') J_m(k'r)\ee^{-\ii m
  \theta}.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
If we now rearrange the order of sumation and integration, and
evaluate the $\theta$ integral, we see that non-vanishing terms are
with $m=n$ and then we get a factor of $2\pi$ like in the previous
section. By introducing the kernel 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:KS-bessel}
K_S^{(n)}(k, k') = \int_{0}^{R_s} \rd{r}\, r J_n(kr) J_n(k'r),
\end{equation}
the energy in $S$ can be written as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:AS-bessel}
A_S =2\pi \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} 
\int_{k_{\min}}^{k_{\max}} \rd{k} \int_{k_{\min}}^{k_{\max}} \rd{k'}\,  
kk'\, b_n(k)b_n^*(k') K_S^{(n)}(k, k')
\end{equation}

If we let the radius $R_S$ of the disk $S$ tend to infinity, by
using the asymptotic behavior of Bessel functions, the kernel becomes
\begin{equation}
K_\infty^{(n)}(k,k') = \frac{\delta(k-k')}{k'}.
\end{equation}
This implies that the total energy
\begin{equation}\label{eq:A-bessel}
\begin{aligned}
A &=2\pi \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} 
\int_{k_{\min}}^{k_{\max}} \rd{k} \int_{k_{\min}}^{k_{\max}} \rd{k'}\,  
kk'\, b_n(k)b_n^*(k') \frac{\delta(k-k')}{k'} \\
&=2\pi \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} 
\int_{k_{\min}}^{k_{\max}} \rd{k} \, k\, b_n(k)b_n^*(k).
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

With \eqref{eq:AS-bessel} and \eqref{eq:A-bessel}, the energy fraction
can be written as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:E-frac-bessel}
\frac{A_S}{A}
=\frac{\displaystyle{\sum_{m}} \int_{k_{\min}}^{k_{\max}} \rd{k} \int_{k_{\min}}^{k_{\max}} \rd{k'}\,  
kk'\, b_m(k)b_m^*(k') K_S^{(m)}(k, k')}
{\displaystyle{\sum_{n}} \int_{k_{\min}}^{k_{\max}} \rd{k} \, k\, b_n(k)b_n^*(k)}.
\end{equation}
By similar arguments as in Section~\ref{sec:SPL-method}, the maximum
of this fraction is given as the largest eigenvalue to
\begin{equation}
\mu_nb_n(k) = \int_{k_{\min}}^{{k_{\max}}}\rd{k}\,k K_S^{(n)}(k, k')\,b_n(k').
\end{equation}
Note that the equation above is different for each $n$, and the
maximum is to be taken over all $n$.

Analagously to the case in the previons section, theis eigenvalue
equation can be symmetrized to
\begin{equation}\label{eq:eig-n-bessel}
\mu_n\phi_n(k) = \int_{k_{\min}}^{{k_{\max}}}\rd{k}\,
\sqrt{kk'} K_S^{(n)}(k, k')\,\phi_n(k').
\end{equation}
This looks suspiciously similar to \eqref{eq:eig-n} from the previous section. And in fact, since both of these methods concern the same problem, \eqref{eq:eig-n-bessel} and \eqref{eq:eig-n} \emph{are} the same equations. Now however, we have an analytical expression for $K_S^{(n)}(k, k')$ (see below). The reason for this equivalence can easily be seen if one writes down the 2D Fourier transform, using polar coordinate, of a Fourier series. 

The advantage of this method is that the kernel
\eqref{eq:KS-bessel} can be calculated analytically
\cite[formula 5.54]{Gradshteyn-Ryzhik}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:kernel_expr}
K_S^{(n)}(k, k') =
\begin{cases}
\frac{R_S}{k^2-k'^2}
\qty[k'J_{n}(R_sk)J_{n-1}(R_sk')-kJ_{n-1}(R_sk)J_{n}(R_sk')]
\qc &k\neq k'\\
\frac{R_S^2}{2}\qty[ \qty(J_{n}(R_Sk))^2
-J_{n-1}(R_sk)J_{n+1}(R_sk)]
\qc &k= k'.
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
So now, the numerical calculation of the eigenvalues are significantly
faster than with the previous method.


\subsection{Energy of a single frequency}
It is also of interest to study how much energy a field limited to one frequency
$\omega_i$ can contain in $S$. Starting from equation \eqref{eq:polar_wave}
and using similar arguments as in the previous section one arrives to the expression
\begin{equation}
A_S=2\pi\sum_n \abs{a_n}^2\int_0^{R_S}\rd r \, r (J_n(k_ir))^2,
\end{equation}
where $k_i={\omega_i}/{v}$ as usual.
The integral is recognized as the one defining the kernel $K_S$, for $k=k'$, and from equation \eqref{eq:kernel_expr} we obtain
\begin{equation}\label{eq:energy_single}
A_S=2\pi \sum_n \abs{a_n}^2\frac{R_S^2}{2}\qty[ \qty(J_{n}(R_Sk_i))^2
-J_{n-1}(R_sk_i)J_{n+1}(R_sk_i)].
  \end{equation}

\section{Results}
In this section the localization measures and limitations described in 
section \ref{sec:measures} have been applied to scalar fields. These 
fields have been built as a sum of solutions to the Helmholtz equation for 
different $k$'s in the interval $[k_{\min},\,k_{\max}]$ and are to be 
seen as representatives of real electric fields in a lossless media 
coming from a bandwidth-limited signal.


\subsection{The Heisenberg inequality for bandwidth-limited functions}
\label{sec:Heisenberg_result}
A bandwidth-limited field in three dimensions will have a Fourier transform that is located on a spherical
shell. Such a distribution has a maximal variance if all of it lies on the outermost layer. The variance
in the frequency domain is then given by $\Delta \tf=(k_{\max})^2$. The Heisenberg inequality \eqref{eq:heisenberg}
now yields
\begin{equation}
\Delta f \geq \frac{9}{4(k_{\max})^2}=\frac{9\lambda_{\min}^2}{16\pi^2}.
\end{equation}
Thus the lowest spacial variation of the field is only dependent on the shortest wavelength $\lambda_{\min}$
and not on the actual bandwidth, since in that solution the longer wavelengths will not be used at all.

\subsection{Energy of bandwidth-limited fields in a bounded region}

In \figref{fig:both} the eigenvalues of \eqref{eq:eig-n-bessel}, with $n=0$, are shown 
for different values of the ratio between the tumor size and the
shortest wavelength, $\RT/\lambda_{\min}=\RT{k_{\max}}/(2\pi)$. 
These values correspond to the theoretical maximum of the energy focused in a
disc-shaped tumor for isotropic (angularly independent) fields in two
dimensions, limited to wavelengths between $\lambda_{\min}$ and
$\lambda_{\max}$. 
The reason we chose to plot for isotropic fields ($n=0$) is that this
corresponded to the largest eigenvalue for most values of $\RT
k_{\max}$, especially the lower ones. 
The different curves correspond to different bandwidth with
$q=\lambda_{\min}/\lambda_{\max}$. The solid curves represent the
fraction of energy in the tumor region to the whole space
($A_\text{T}/A$) while the dashed curves represent the fraction of
energy in the tumor to a ``head'' region ($A_\text{T}/A_\text{H}$), a
ten times larger concentric disc. These dashed lines do not represent
the maximum fraction in the tumor compared to the head, instead they
correspond to the functions that maximized $A_\text{T}/A$ but this
time ``normalized''  to the energy in the head. 

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\centerline{ % centers figures larges than 1\textwidth
\includegraphics[width=15cm]{ring_both_L1000.eps}
}
\caption{Theoretical maximum of energy fraction inside the tumor for
  isotropic fields, both compared to the total energy in real space
  (solid line) as well as compared to a ``head'' region (dashed
  line). The fractions are plotted as a function of tumor size, $\RT$,
  measured in shortest wavelengths, $\lambda_{\min}$. The different
  values of $q\in[0, 1]$ corresponds to the width of the frequency
  band, where $\lambda_{\min}=2\pi/k_{\max}$ and
  $q=\lambda_{\min}/\lambda_{\max}$, i.e. a larger $q$ means a
  narrower band. The head and tumor regions used were concentrical
  discs; where the radius of the head region was $10\RT$. } 
\label{fig:both}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

For small q-values ($0$ and $0.1$) the energy fractions approach 1
quite quickly and for $\RT/\lambda_{\min} \sim 0.5$ and larger it is
possible to have almost all the energy located in the tumor. It is
also apparant that the bandwidth plays a significant role for the
localization; for $q=0.5$ only about 50\,\% of the energy is focused
in a tumor with $\RT/\lambda_{\min}=0.5$ and for $q=0.9$ less than
10\,\%. 
This explains the relatively small differences between the dashed and
solid curves; for small $q$-values, focusing in the tumor apparantly
concentrates almost all the energy in the head. Intuitively it makes sense
that focusing in the head is achieved when focusing in the center of
the head and from the figure it is apparant that it \emph{is} possible
to focus almost all the energy in a head ten times the tumor for all
but the largest $q$-values and smallest tumor radii $\RT$. For larger
$q$-values the comparison with the head does however make a difference since
these fractions do not converge as quickly to 1.  

The figure also clearly shows that, when comparing to the head, it
\emph{is} possible to achieve some localization even for a single
frequency. For $\RT \approx \lambda_{\min}/4$ one achieves a maximum
of approximately 0.15. That is one can focus roughly 15\,\% of the
energy in the head into only 1\,\% of the \emph{area}. 



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Discussion and outlook}

The results of this report give a theoretical limit to the
concentration, in two dimensions, of a bandwidth-limited field.
As is shown in Section \ref{sec:Heisenberg_result} the Heisenberg 
inequality only concerns the highest frequency in the band and not
the bandwidth. This is due to the fact that in two or more dimensions
there is also a \emph{directional} freedom involved for the wave 
vector $\vb*k$. However as is noted in Section \ref{sec:Heisenberg_theory}
the variance measure used in the Heisenberg inequality is not a 
good measure for hyperthermia treatment and therefore the measure of
Slepian et al. was mainly studied in this report.

Due to time constraints a scalar field was studied in this report.
The actual electric field is a vector field which has to satisfy
\emph{all} of Maxwell's equations, and not only the wave
equation. This imposes the constraint that the field vector has to be
perpendicular to its direction of propagation, which will exclude
isotropic fields in three dimensions \cite{Jackson}.
However, in the two dimensional case the electric field can be thuoght
of as pointing in a third ($\vu{z}$) direction.

A somewhat related detail is the fact that \figref{fig:both} only
presents the energy fractions for $n=0$. To find the
real optimum one has to find the largest eigenvalue $\mu_n$ over all
$n$, i.e. also including non-isotropic fields. Indeed, when this was investigated
numerically we found regions where $n>0$ had a larger energy
fraction. However $\mu_0$ was in most cases the largest eigenvalue,
and it does give a good representation of what the maximum 
energy fraction could be. 

In spite of not being directly applicable to actual electric fields in
three dimensions,
the results can still be used to obtain 
qualitative insights concerning the limitations imposed by the
wave-nature. For instance, \figref{fig:both} shows that almost all the
energy of a field can be focused into a region of the same scale as
the shortest wavelength. If however the signal is limited to a
\emph{narrow} band of frequencies, then the possible fraction of
energy in the tumor quickly falls off. 
For focusing electric field intensity in
a bounded region it is therefore prefered to use a wide band
signal. Due to an effect of time-averaging, this is however not true for
hyperthermia treatments which will be discussed in the following
section. 

\subsection{Relation to hyperthermia tretment -- Specific Absorption Rate}
\label{sec:SAR}
In hyperthermia treatment a good indicator for the temperature
increase is the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR): 
\begin{equation}
\text{SAR}(\vb*x)=
\frac{\ev{\vb*J(\vb*x,t)\vdot \vb*E(\vb*x,t)}_t}{\rho(\vb*x)},
\end{equation}
where $\vb*J$ is the current density, $\vb*E$ is the
electric field, $\rho$ is the mass density, and $\ev{\cdot}_t$ denotes
time-averaging. 
Due to Ohm's law this is simply a weighted version of the intensity
$\abs{\vb*E}^2$.

However, because of the time-averaging, interference between multiple
frequencies vanishes \cite{Martinsson}. Thus
\begin{equation}
\text{SAR}(\vb*x)=\sum_i\text{SAR}_{\omega_i}(\vb*x),
\end{equation}
that is a sum of the contribution from each frequency.
Due to this linearity, and since a finite energy will always be
applied, it can be proven from the theory of convex optimization
that a large family of of goal functions, convex ones, are optimized
by using a single frequency only\cite{Boyd}. In particular, this applies to any
linear goal function such as the main goal function used in this paper 
\eqref{eq:energy_frac_final}. Therefore if it was applied to SAR it
would be maximized by a single frequency.   



\subsection{Further extensions of the SPL method}
The results were for a rather simple special case and it would
therefore be desirable to expand the domain of applicability for the
SPL method. Some of the main points of improvement are to include other 
geometries, taking the healthy
tissue into account, and allowing for lossy materials.

\subsubsection{Optimization relative to healthy tissue}
To generalize \eqref{eq:energy_frac_final} to
incorporate a head region, of healthy tissue, the measure has to
be changed to $\ip*{I_\text{T}\tf}{\tf}/\ip*{I_\text{H}\tf}{\tf}$, where 
$I_\text{T}$ and $I_\text{H}$ are defined as in \eqref{eq:int_op} with
$S$ replaced by the tumor and head regions respectively. 
This new problem can be proven to be optimized by solving the
generalized eigenvalue problem $I_\text{T}\psi'=\mu'I_\text{H}\psi'$.

Conceptually this should be easily implemented in the numerical method
in Appendix~\ref{apx:num}. However when we tried to solve the
generalized eigenvalue problem the numerics turned out to be badly
conditioned due to the matrices, corresponding to $I_\text{H}$, being
almost singular. Because of this, we instead chose to calculate
$A_\text{T}/A_\text{H}$ for the regular eigenvector,
$I_\text{T}\psi=\mu\psi$. 

For a head considerably larger than the tumor the
regular eigenvalues are almost 1, as seen in \figref{fig:both}. This
means that the head then already contains close to all of the energy
in the field, which means that the values presented in
\figref{fig:both} are not significantly different from the generalized
eigenvalue. 
This is not completely true for the low values of
$\RT/\lambda_{\min}$ and high values of $q$; however, in the case with
$q=0.9$ the agreement with the (true) optimum for $q=1$ indicates that
using the regular eigenfuntion did not introduce any significant
deviation from the generalized eigenvalue.


\subsubsection{Different geometries and lossy materials}
The SPL technique, as presented in Section~\ref{sec:measures}, is
still valid for any general geometry, in any number of dimensions.
The trade-off, for complicated geometries, would however be that more
of the calculations would have to be done numerically instead of 
analytically. 

To further improve applicability to hyperhtermia treatment the SPL
method could also be extended to incorporate a weight function in the
head operator $I_\text{H}$. This weight function could take extra
sensitive tissue into account by giving it a high weight, and thus
setting a high ``price'' on intensity in that area. 

Another improvement would be to also incorporate the fact that tissue
consists of lossy (electrically conducting) materials. 
The field will decay when propagating, thus the
actual source of the field and its position has to be accounted
for. Lossy material can therefore not be described by a simple 
Fourier transfom, and the SPL method cannot be applied in its current
form. 

Mathematically the lossy material can be described by changing to a complex
wavenumber $k\to\tilde{k}$. Although we have not studied the mathematics 
fully, we believe that the key concepts of the SPL method could
still be used with e.g. a basis of fields emanating from discrete sources, 
instead of plane waves like earlier. 
%\footnotemark{}.

% \footnotetext{We also believ that one of the Hankel functions,
% $H_\nu^{(1, 2)}(r'\tilde{k})=J_\nu(r'\tilde{k})\pm\ii N_\nu(r'\tilde{k})$,
% centered around each source is the most effective representations 
% (in 2D) of the field eaming from the sources. This is because the 
% field then will exhibit exponential decay as it propagates away from 
% its source.
% }

%By now, we also need to address the fact that 
If the SPL method is generalized far enough according to the above
description, it would become very similar to an already used method
described by Köhler et al. \cite{Kohler2001}. Their method uses
simulated fields from a given antenna system as a basis for the field
inside the head, and then they formulate the optimization as a generalized eigenvalue problem. 
However, the SPL method was never intended to be used as a substitute
to the method in \cite{Kohler2001} for treatment planning. 
Instead its purpose was to gain theoretical insight on the limitations
imposed by the wave nature on a field. In a similar manner, a more
generalized method could be used to study the field in more elaborate
models. This could for instance give insight into the problem of
choosing an optimal frequency depending on some simple parameters like
head and tumor size.
For a generalized SPL method to be effective, the governing differential 
equations have to be analytically solvable. Otherwise one could just as well use the
method in \cite{Kohler2001}.

\section{Conclusions}
In this report a mathematical framework, developed by Slepian et al.,
has been applied to bandwidth limited functions in two dimensions. It
is shown that even though it is possible to focus an electric field with only
one frequency a wide band of frequencies significantly improves the effect.
However, since time-averaging cancels interference between frequencies 
the improvements of a wide frequency band diminishes
in hyperthermia treatments.

\section{Numerical implementation of the 
SPL Method}
\label{apx:num}
In the report we have been occupied by integral eigenvalue
equations of the form
\begin{equation} %\label{eq:int-eig}
\mu E(k) 
= \oldint_{\Omega} \rd^D{k}\, K(k, k') E(k')
\qcomma k, k'\in\Omega.
\end{equation}
We have also put down some work to reduce higher-dimensional
integrals to one-dimensional ones
\begin{equation} \label{eq:int-eig}
\mu \psi(k) 
= \int_{\alpha}^\beta \rd{k}\, K(k, k') \psi(k'),
\end{equation}
where the integration is now over an interval 
$[\alpha, \beta]$. This was done so that the numerical method
presented here could be applied. 


\subsection{Discretization of the integral equation}
The integral can be discretized according to
\begin{equation} \label{eq:inttosum}
\begin{aligned}
 \int_{\alpha}^\beta \rd{k} &\to \sum_{n=1}^N\Delta{k}
=\frac{(\beta-\alpha)}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N,\\
\psi(k) \to \psi_n = \psi(k_n) &\qcomma
K(k, k') \to K_{m, n} = K(k_m, k_n),
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
With these discretizations, \eqref{eq:int-eig} discretizes to
\begin{equation}
\mu\Psi_m = \frac{(\beta-\alpha)}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N K_{m, n} \Psi_n
\end{equation}
which is just a matrix eigenvalue equation
\begin{equation} \label{eq:mtx-eig}
\mu' \Psi = \mathsf{K}\Psi,
\end{equation}
where $\mu'=N\mu/(\beta-\alpha)$ and $\mathsf{K}$ is the $N\times N$ matrix
whose element $(m, n)$ is $K_{m, n}$. From here, there are many high
performance linear algebra libraries to find the eigenvalues and
eigenvector to \eqref{eq:mtx-eig} numerically. 

%\subsubsection{Symmetrization }
%We can also
Note that some effort was put into making the integral
kernel symmetric. This not only has the effect of guarateeing that the
eigenvectors of different eigenvalues will be orthogonal, but is also
beneficial to most numerical methods to find eigenvalues. 


% \subsubsection{Physical interpretation}
% An interesting physical interpretation of the discretization is that
% the operation \eqref{eq:inttosum} can be viewed as introducing
% \begin{equation}
% \Delta{k}\qty[\delta(k-k_0) + \delta(k-k_1) +\ldots+\delta(k-k_N)]
% \end{equation}
% into the integral, and effectively limiting the frequencydomain
% $\Omega$ to the dicrete frequencies $k_n$. 

% This idea could possibly be more cloesly related to reality, where the
% differnt antennas only transmitts in certain dicrete frequencies. And
% thus the discretized eigenvalue problem gives the theoretical maximum
% energy in a bounded region in space from a signal restriced to the
% chosen frequencies. 
% It is however worth pointing out that this result has only been proven
% for the 1D case\cite{PSWF-V_1978}, but there is no reason to believ
% that the discetized version cannot be extended to higher dimension
% like in the continuous case. 


\subsection{Verification of the numerical method}
To verify that the method above is sound, we have here compared some calculated eigenvalues for different values of $R_Sk_{\max}$ to the ones given in \cite{PSWF-IV_1964}. In \tabref{tab:verification}, we see that the relative error (bold) is very small. It is therefore highly likely that the method is sound.
