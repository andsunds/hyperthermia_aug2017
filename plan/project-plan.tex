\section{Introduction}
\todo[inline]{General intro to hyopthermia and freq dep.}

This project will study the study the efficacy of
ultra-wideband (UWB) treatmants in comparison to narrowband (NB).
Previously, such comparisons have been conducted using numerical or
experimantal methods. In this project we intend to
investigate this subject from a more theoretical and mathematical
stand point. 

Where as prior studies have found indications that an UWB approach
does not significantly improve performance. This project aims to find 
theoretical grounds for this claim. 


\section{Method}


\begin{enumerate}
\item Heisenberg: What is it exactly and how does it affect UWB vs NB?
- Implementation with EM-waves.
\item Investigate focusing effect of head geometry. -Explanation to
why some specific frequency is the best.
\item Solve details regarding frequency components and interference
(Fourier) and the step to amplitudes. 
\end{enumerate}
\todo{clarify}

\section{Time allocation}
Finish this!

Our plan is to finish points 1 and 2 on the 16th. Point 3 is more
vague, and no final time plan can be set up.
